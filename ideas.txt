These are our possible ideas for the advertisement for TheCafeProject.

This poster must include very big images of pizzas, as well as a few amount of words, that people will be able to read as they walk by.

This poster should be created using things such as Photoshop, as well as physical drafts that will let us express our ideas into real life.

As well as having few amounts of words, there should also be small tiny words towards the bottom of the poster, including many small details, such as how this app only includes Pizza Hut, and this app is only accessible at the Allen Highschool.
